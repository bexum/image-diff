# image-diff
A deep image diff example that using opencv.js.

## Usage
The repository using haskell stack and follow the [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable) working way.

The simple way to run it is:
```shell
$ stack run
```

and furthermore, see [stack docs](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable).

## Thought
For using OpenCV.js to compare twp image, follow the step:
- cvtColor
- absdiff
- threshold
- findContours
- drawContours

See more at [source code](https://github.com/Haskell-Language-China/image-diff/blob/main/src/Action.hs).
